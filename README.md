How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure the functionality and security of my coding projects, I will follow industry best practices, maintain latest on all my software, and test my code. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To meet user needs, I will err on the side of simplicity, and aim toward meeting stated requirements and not overthinking the process. Following this rule will provide users with the requested functionality without creating unnecessary code. If my interpretation of a requirement is incorrect, it will mean less work to redo and help clarify user requests. 


How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from a black-box perspective. The purpose of code is to accomplish a task, and I let the requirements of that task drive my development. I also consider the long-term implications of program functionality and scalability to determine which data structures I should use.
